Let's give a face to MASHI!

MASHI is a tele-presence and/or tele-operated robot. 
It features a LCD screen in the facial region.

This project was created in the context of and builds on the source code provided within the UPC lecture Cognitive Interaction with Robots.
The project seeks to use the robot's face to provide conversation partners of MASHI with natural feedback on the robot's emotion.
